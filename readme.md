# Forest Fire Graph

This is a new implementation of the forest_fire problem in rust.
At this stage it is just a dolled up varient of my old solution,
and is a work in progress. It does not yet implement spreading fires.

## Goal
To create a graph structure for the forest, to make it more efficient to locate and mutate the state of the tree's neighbors.
